I think that my day without computer science would be somewhat boring, because practically all day I use my cell phone and other devices where I can use applications, every day I use school applications to be able to do my homework, and on my phone I use applications to watch movies and Instagram, I think you couldn't be in a world without technology because if the world is the same as it is now, the danger would be very great and I would also have to be alone in my house all day.
